### Environmental setup

You need to have the `dslabs`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `lubridate` packages installed. If not yet, please run `install.packages(c("dslabs", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate"))` in your R environment. If you have installed the `tidyverse` package, `dplyr` is installed by default.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load the required packages
# install.packages(c("dslabs", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "lubridate"))
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

### Example question. Print the first 2 records of the murders dataset.

```{r}
data("murders")
head(murders, 2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. (1 points) Define a matrix `mat` with 10 rows and 5 columns, print the entries of rows 5-8 and columns 2 & 5 simultaneously.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:50, 10, 5)
mat[5:8, c(2, 5)]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. (1 points) Write a function `compute_s_n` that for any given n, computes the $S_n = \frac{n*ln(n+5)}{\sqrt{n}}$. Print $S_n$ for $n$ from 10 to 20. (Hint: use `sapply`)

```{r}
comput_s_n <- function(n){
  return n*ln(n+5)/(n^(1/2))
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. (2 points) Examine the built-in datasets `ChickWeight` and `co2`. Which of the following is true?

-   

    a.  tidy data: all small datasets are tidy by definition.

-   

    b.  tidy data: it has one observation for each row.

-   

    c.  not tidy: there are multiple rows corresponding to the same observation.

-   

    d.  not tidy: it is a matrix instead of a data frame.

`ChickWeight` is [Input here]

`co2` is [Input here]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. (12 points) Utilize the murders dataset and execute the following tasks.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data("murders")
```

#### a. (2 points) Compute the murder rate per 100,000 people for each state and store it in a column called "rate". Then use logical operators to find which state has a murder rate per 100,000 people higher than 5. Find these states, print their state names, abbreviations, total populations, and murder rates.

```{r}

```

#### b. (2 points) For all states having a murder rate per 100,000 people higher than 5, use the barplot function to create a barplot with the x-axis being the state name, and the y-axis being the murder rate per 100,000 people of each state. Order them by their murder rates. (Hints: check some barplot examples at <https://r-graph-gallery.com/210-custom-barplot-layout.html>)

```{r}

```

#### c. (3 points) Create a table called `my_states` that contains rows for states satisfying two conditions: 1) population is lower than 5 million, and 2) the murder rate per 100,000 people is less than 3.0. Use `select` to show only their state abbreviations, populations, and murder rates. Then use `top_n` function to find the 3 safest states among them.

```{r}

```

#### d. (2 points) Categorize all states into two groups based on their population: Above median population – states with a population greater than the median. Below median population – states with a population less than or equal to the median. For each group, calculate the average murder rate per 100,000 people and display the results.

```{r}

```

#### e. (3 points) Use the ggplot2 package to create a scatterplot from the murders dataset, where the x-axis is the number of population, the y-axis is the murder rate per 100,000 people, and each point in the scatterplot is labeled with the state name. Please add an appropriate title, and axis labels to the plot. Select a theme that you prefer.

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. (4 points) Factors affecting life expectancy with `gapminder`

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data("gapminder")
```

#### a. (2 points) Calculate the average life expectancy and GDP per capita for each continent in 2000. (Hint: Select data from year 2000, group by **continent** and compute for each continent: (i) average **life_expectancy**, and (ii) **gdp** per capita.) Sort the results by average life expectancy.

```{r}

```

#### b. (2 points) Show the **distribution** of life expectancy for each continent. Use an appropriate plot (**density** or **histogram**).

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. (7 points) Tropical cyclones with `storms` (from **dplyr**)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)  # for timestamps
data("storms")
```

#### a. (1 point) List the observation with the **largest wind** speed.

```{r}

```

#### b. (2 points) For (1) the whole dataset, (2) by **year**, compute both: (i) the **maximum wind** and (ii) the **minimum pressure** observed. For the per-year stats, sort the results by maximum wind (descending) and show the top 10 rows.

```{r}
# (1) Whole dataset

```

```{r}
# (2) By year

```

#### c. (1 point) Create a **scatter plot** of **wind** vs **pressure**. Note that the wind speeds are recorded in knots and pressures are recorded in millibars. Add a title and axis labels.

```{r}

```

#### d. (3 points) Create a **multi-line plot** for all storms from August, 2005, showing **timestamp** on x-axis and **wind** on y-axis, with color indicating **storm name**. Add a legend, title, and labels. (Hint: use functions from the `lubridate` package to define timestamps)

```{r}

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. (23 points) Explore the tidyverse with the COVID-19 dataset (<http://www.bio8.cs.hku.hk/comp2501/covid.csv>), and answer the following questions. Noticeably, it is acceptable to analyze the data or generate a plot with negative values of cases and deaths.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```

#### a. (2 points) Read the CSV formatted dataset. Find out how many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are in the dataset. Print the names of all variables.

```{r}

```

#### b. (1 points) List 5 observations that have the most amounts of `deaths` per day.

```{r}

```

#### c. (2 points) How many unique `countriesAndTerritories` are in the dataset?

```{r}

```

#### d. (3 points) For (1) the whole dataset, (2) different `countriesAndTerritories`, and (3) different `continentExp`, compute both (i) the sum of cases, and (ii) the sum of deaths. Sort the results by the sum of deaths descendingly. Use `head` to show the top 3 entries if there are too many rows.

```{r}
# (1) Whole dataset

```

```{r}
# (2) By countries and territories

```

```{r}
# (3) By continents

```

#### e. (1 points) Add a new column `date` with the standard date format "YYYY-MM-DD" to the data table according to the `dateRep` column. Be reminded the format of `dateRep` is "DD/MM/YYYY". Please use head() to show the result. (Hint: use functions from the `lubridate` package to read and write timestamps)

```{r}

```

#### f. (2 points) Create a scatterplot showing `cases` vs. `deaths`. Set an appropriate plot title and axis titles. Are there any dots that seem abnormal? Exclude those and plot again.

```{r}

```

#### g. (2 points) Create a line plot showing cases per day versus date for China. Set an appropriate plot title and axis titles.

```{r}

```

#### h. (2 points) Similar to above, create a line plot using the data of six countries with the most total cases. Use different line colors for each country. Set an appropriate plot title and axis titles.

```{r}

```

#### i. (4 points) Filter out the data in Germany. Assume the Germany government determined an epidemic situation of national significance on 2020-06-10. A lot of restrictive measurements such as social distancing were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Find out the 1) average number of cases before the determination, 2) average number of cases after the determination, 3) average number of deaths before the determination, and 4) average number of deaths after the determination. Remove missing values from data if they are coded as NA, if there is any.

```{r}

```

#### j. (4 points) In fact, the determination of epidemic situation was on another date. Make a reasonable guess with explanation by the following steps. Create a line plot using data with `countriesAndTerritories=="Germany"`, showing date on the x-axis, cases per day and death per day on the y-axis. Observe the pattern and make a reasonable guess. Find a way to indicate the date of the determination and 1 month after the date of determination. Set an appropriate plot title and axis titles. Marks would be given on answers with reasonable explanations. (Hints: It is expected that the cases confirmed would drop after 1 month of the implementation of determination of epidemic situation, with 14-week incubation period of COVID-19. It is a relatively open question, and reasonable explanations are acceptable. We want you to observe the trend of changes in the cases per day and the deaths per day on the date you have chosen and one month after it according to the line plot you created. No correct date is needed and we will judge your answers according to your thoughts and explanations.)
