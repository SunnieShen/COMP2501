### logistics
The project proposal submission will be in the form of Moodle quiz, answer the following: 
1. A tentative **topic** of your project; 
2. The tentative **source of data** you plan to use for the project; 
3. One to two **data science questions** you want to answer with the data; 
4. A **short proposal (within 300 words)** stating: 
	• **Importance** of the question(s); 
	• **Challenges/difficulties** envisioned in answering the question(s)? 
	• If there are notable **existing works** related to the question(s), describe them briefly. 
	• A brief **overview of your planned approach or methods**. 
5. Do you want to give a short 10 min presentation (+5 min Q&A) in-class? 
 - 5-point bonus to your raw midterm (60) and final (~90) scores, subject to the maximum score limit

##### idea from Deepseek:
- 香港人才流失与引入
	- 格局分析: 总量、结构
	- 趋势: 时间、净流入、流出?
	- 匹配度: 人才的专业技能 Vs 香港重点发展的产业需求 &rarr; ? 水土不服? 才高就低
	- 留存情况分析
# report 
• Compose your report in **R Markdown** and knit it into an html page; 
• Include the data files used in your analysis in the submission, i.e., zip them together; 
	• Or add a note if the data is private or too large to be uploaded (>100M, in which case attach a link to the data); 
• Ensure your R Markdown file is fully runnable and reproducible. 
• Include graphics (preferably), data visualization, description, and analysis to explain what you are doing and what data insights you have gained from the results/plots. **The report should NOT contain only codes.** 
• Add in-line comments in code blocks to explain your codes wherever necessary. 
• Note that your project report may be shared with future students of this course.
