### logistics
The project proposal submission will be in the form of Moodle quiz, answer the following: 
1. A tentative **topic** of your project; 
	1) model how stress and working conditions impact mental health 
	2) "Predicting Mental Health Treatment Needs Based on Workplace Factors and Demographic Characteristics"
2. The tentative **source of data** you plan to use for the project;
	Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset from Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI), similar to the dataset used in the analyzed notebook, containing survey responses about mental health in workplace settings.
	https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data
3. One to two **data science questions** you want to answer with the data; 
	1) Which workplace factors and demographic characteristics are most predictive of needing mental health treatment?
	2) how to build a machine learning model to identify individuals who would benefit from mental health intervention based on their survey responses?
4. A **short proposal (within 300 words)** stating: 
	-  **Importance** of the question(s); 
	Mental health issues in workplace environments is a significant public health concern with economic and social consequences. Early identification of individuals who need mental health support can facilitate timely intervention, reduce workplace productivity loss, and improve overall well-being. This project addresses the need for data-driven approaches to mental health screening in professional settings.
	- **Challenges/difficulties** envisioned in answering the question(s)? 
	Several challenges are anticipated, including handling ==class imbalance== in the target variable, managing missing survey data, and addressing potential ==response bias==. The subjective nature of self-reported mental health data may introduce noise. 
	- If there are notable **existing works** related to the question(s), describe them briefly. 
	Previous research has established correlations between workplace stress and mental health outcomes. The analyzed notebook demonstrates successful application of multiple machine learning algorithms to similar mental health prediction tasks, achieving approximately 80-85% accuracy with ensemble methods. Existing literature shows that factors like work interference, family history, and employer support significantly impact mental health treatment needs.
	 - A brief **overview of your planned approach or methods**. 
	 1. data loading and exploration using tidyverse
	 2. data cleaning: remove irrelevant columns, handle missing value and outliers. 
	 3. standardizing variables and data type conversion
	 4. data analysis and visualization using ggplot2: uncover patterns, relationships, and potential biases in the data. This will include examining the bivariate relationships between workplace factors and the outcome variable (treatment).
	 5. statistical modeling using logistic regression: Identify key predictors using logistic regression to quantify relationships between predictors and treatment-seeking behaviour. We will complement this with subgroup analyses to examine how these relationships vary by gender, country, and company size
	 6. conclusion

- Tentative Source of Data
Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset from Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI), similar to the dataset used in the analyzed notebook, containing survey responses about mental health in workplace settings.

- Data Science Questions
1. Which workplace factors and demographic characteristics are most predictive of needing mental health treatment?
2. Can we build an accurate machine learning model to identify individuals who would benefit from mental health intervention based on their survey responses?
- Short Proposal 
	
	**Importance**: Mental health issues in workplace environments represent a significant public health concern with substantial economic and social consequences. Early identification of individuals who need mental health support can facilitate timely intervention, reduce workplace productivity loss, and improve overall well-being. This project addresses the critical need for data-driven approaches to mental health screening in professional settings.
	
	**Challenges/Difficulties**: Several challenges are anticipated, including handling class imbalance in the target variable, managing missing survey data, and addressing potential response bias. The subjective nature of self-reported mental health data may introduce noise, and ensuring model interpretability for practical healthcare applications presents additional complexity. Feature selection from numerous survey variables while avoiding overfitting requires careful methodology.
	
	**Existing Works**: Previous research has established correlations between workplace stress and mental health outcomes. The analyzed notebook demonstrates successful application of multiple machine learning algorithms to similar mental health prediction tasks, achieving approximately 80-85% accuracy with ensemble methods. Existing literature shows that factors like work interference, family history, and employer support significantly impact mental health treatment needs.
	
	**Planned Approach**: Our methodology will follow a structured pipeline: comprehensive data preprocessing including handling missing values and outlier detection; feature engineering to transform categorical variables and create meaningful features; exploratory data analysis to understand variable relationships; implementation of multiple classification algorithms (logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks); hyperparameter optimization using grid search and cross-validation; and rigorous model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. We will emphasize model interpretability to identify the most influential factors in mental health treatment prediction.
	
	**This approach will provide valuable insights for employers and healthcare providers to develop targeted mental health support programs.**

## Mental Health Treatment Prediction 

### **Slide 1: Crisis in Tech**
"In the tech industry, we celebrate innovation and disruption, but we rarely talk about the human cost. Behind the screens and code, there's a silent crisis affecting thousands of professionals. My project addresses this critical question: **Can we use data to identify who needs mental health support before it's too late?**"
- ==+ data?news?fact?==
### **Slide 2: The Core Problem **
"The challenge is clear: mental health issues often go **undetected** until they become severe. But what if we could **spot the warning signs early**? This led me to two key **research questions**"
1. "Which workplace factors and personal characteristics most strongly predict mental health treatment needs?"
2. "How can we build a practical tool to identify at-risk individuals for timely intervention?"
**importance**
- **For employees:** Early detection means better outcomes and less suffering
- **For companies:** Mental health issues cost US businesses $200 billion annually
- **For society:** Reducing stigma through data-driven approaches
### **Slide 3: Data Foundation**
"To answer these questions, I turned to real-world data from the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey - one of the largest datasets of its kind."
**Data Source**
- 1,259 observation
- 27 variables covering demographics, work environment, and mental health history
==Real responses from real people facing real challenges==
**Data Challenges We Faced:**
- sampling bias
- Self-reporting biases , not standardized
- ==non-linear interaction???(not data itself)==
### **Slide 4: What the Data Revealed - Key Patterns**
factor-treatment correlation &rarr; regression model 
"Important patterns we discovered"

==demographic==
Age
family_history
Gender
==work_place==
**Work_interference**(EXP)
support_system
### **Slide 5: Logistic Regression
"Turning these patterns into predictions required a rigorous analytical framework. We built a model that learns from these relationships to identify at-risk individuals."
**Why We Chose Logistic Regression:**
- Provides interpretable results - we can understand WHY someone is at risk
- Gives probability scores, not just yes/no classifications
**Key Technical Points:**
- 70/30 ==train-test split==for honest evaluation
- Comprehensive multicollinearity checks
- Focus on both accuracy AND interpretability
### **Slide 7: The Most Important Predictors**
"what actually matters when predicting mental health needs? Our analysis revealed a clear hierarchy of factors..."
**Top Predictors (bar chart showing relative importance)**
1. **Work Interference** (24x increased risk)
2. **Family History** (3x increased risk)  
3. **Access to Care Options** (2x variation)
4. **Gender** (males 60% less likely to seek help)
5. **Coworker Support** (2.4x with supportive colleagues)
finding
"Work interference wasn't just important - it was the strongest predictor. This suggests that observable workplace impacts might be the most reliable early warning sign."
### **Slide 6: Model Performance - Does It Work? 
"So, does our model actually work? The results are promising..."
**Performance Metrics:**
- **85% accuracy** in identifying treatment needs
- **0.84 AUC score** - excellent at distinguishing high-risk individuals
- **89% specificity** - minimal false alarms
- **63% sensitivity** - good at catching true cases

**What This Means Practically:**
- Can identify 8-9 out of 10 employees who genuinely need support
- Minimizes unnecessary interventions
- Provides actionable risk scores, not just binary labels

Clean ROC curve with clear performance benchmarks


==(Slide 8-10: from Deepseek)==
==how to conclude???==
### ==**Slide 8: From Data to Action - Practical Applications (1 minute)**==

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Proactive HR outreach** to high-risk employees
- **Benefits optimization** based on actual risk factors
- **Manager training** focused on early warning signs
- **New hire support** tailored to individual risk profiles
### **Slide 9: Limitations & Responsible Use 
**Script:**
"Of course, no model is perfect, and this approach requires careful, ethical implementation."

**Important Caveats:**
- This identifies ==correlation, not causation(already solved---> random forest)==
- Should enable support, not discrimination  
- Must complement human judgment, not replace it
- Requires strict privacy protections

"Prediction for support, not surveillance. Data for empowerment, not evaluation."
### **Slide 10: Conclusion & Future Vision (45 seconds)**
**Script:**
"==So, did we answer our original questions?== "

**Key Conclusions:**
- Work interference and family history are the strongest predictors
- We can build accurate, practical identification tools
- Data can help transform mental health from reactive to proactive
**Looking Ahead:**
- Expand to more industries beyond tech
- Incorporate real-time workplace data
- Test different intervention strategies
- Build more sophisticated prediction models
**Final Thought:**
"In the end, this isn't just about better algorithms. It's about creating workplaces where people don't have to struggle in silence. Where data serves humanity, not the other way around."


### ==(more)==

data insight but related to my original question???
**Slide: Beyond Simple Correlations - The Power of Interaction Effects**
risk factors don't operate in isolation - they amplify or buffer each other.

1. work interference and family history, interact with each other
- For employees without family history, even frequent work interference leads to only 60% treatment rate
- But for those with family history, the same level of work interference drives treatment rates above 90%
- **Business Insight**: This tells us screening should prioritize employees who report both family history AND work interference

1. gender and benefits
- Male employees are highly sensitive to benefits availability - treatment rates drop sharply without benefits  
- Female employees remain relatively stable, less affected by benefits access
- So, I**mproving mental health benefits may be particularly effective for increasing male help-seeking behavior**"

1. non-linear affect of Age
- Treatment needs peak twice: first in early adulthood (25-35 years), then again in mid-life (45-55 years)
- not simple 'older = higher risk' assumptions

1. random forest (==correlation indicates causation??? No==)
- Random forest model independently confirms feature importance rankings
- **Work interference, family history, and age** consistently rank as top predictors across different methods
